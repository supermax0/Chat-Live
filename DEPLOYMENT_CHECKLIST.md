# ✅ Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Cleanup

### ✅ Removed Development Files
- [x] `server.js` - Old Node.js server (removed)
- [x] `package.json` - Node.js dependencies (removed)
- [x] `package-lock.json` - Node.js lock file (removed)
- [x] `socket.io/` - Old Socket.IO files (removed)
- [x] `node_modules/` - Should be ignored by .gitignore

### ✅ Database Files
- [x] `chat.db` - Ignored by .gitignore (will be created on server)
- [x] `chat.db-shm` - Ignored by .gitignore
- [x] `chat.db-wal` - Ignored by .gitignore

### ✅ Requirements
- [x] `requirements.txt` - Cleaned and organized with comments
- [x] All dependencies pinned to specific versions
- [x] Production dependencies only (no dev dependencies)

### ✅ Uploads Folder
- [x] `uploads/` directory structure preserved
- [x] `.gitkeep` files in place
- [x] Actual uploads ignored (only structure tracked)

### ✅ Render.com Ready
- [x] `Procfile` - Production start command
- [x] `render.yaml` - Infrastructure as code
- [x] `runtime.txt` - Python version specified
- [x] `.gunicorn.conf.py` - Gunicorn configuration

## Environment Variables Needed

Set these in Render.com:
- `SECRET_KEY` - Flask secret key (auto-generated by Render)
- `FLASK_ENV=production`
- `DATABASE_URL=./chat.db` (or path to persistent disk)
- `PORT` - Automatically set by Render

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Clean project for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Render**
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Render will auto-detect `render.yaml`
   - Add persistent disk for database
   - Set environment variables

3. **Verify**
   - Check all pages load
   - Test WebSocket connections
   - Verify file uploads work
   - Check database persistence

## Notes

- All dev files removed
- Only production dependencies in requirements.txt
- Uploads folder structure preserved
- Database will be created automatically on first run
- All static files properly organized

**Status**: ✅ Ready for deployment
